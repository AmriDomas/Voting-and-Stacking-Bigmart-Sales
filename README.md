# ðŸ›’ BigMart Sales Prediction: Ensemble Models with Voting and Stacking

Welcome to the **BigMart Sales Prediction** project! This repository demonstrates how to leverage the power of ensemble learning techniques, including **Voting Regressor** and **Stacking Regressor**, to predict sales with high accuracy. By combining the strengths of models like `AdaBoostRegressor`, `GradientBoostingRegressor`, and `RandomForestRegressor`, along with `Ridge` as the stacking meta-learner, we deliver robust predictions for BigMart sales.
